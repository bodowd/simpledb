This is an educational project to explore concepts around relational databases and to build a simple, functional relational database management system.
The project follows the book Database Design and Implementation by Edward Sciore.
The code is a port of Edward Sciore's SimpleDB from Java to C++, and is heavily inspired by rotaki's version.
